# SOEN 487 Project

This repository is for the SOEN 487 final project at Concordia University. You can find details about the contributors [here](https://github.com/vartanbeno/SOEN487-Project/wiki).

The project is a full stack microservices application for sending and receiving messages between users. Our project is broken down into 3 services:

- Authentication service
- Messaging service
- Notification service

The project is currently hosted [here](http://vartanbeno.com:50000/), but it is highly encouraged to read the full [project report](Project%20Report.pdf) before trying it out.
 
# Getting Started

### Running

To start the application, we need to run the frontend and each microservice in the backend:

#### Frontend

`cd` into the `client` folder and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will be served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

#### Backend

`cd` into the `server` folder. You will see one folder for each of the microservices. `cd` into each of them and run the `app.py` file:

```
python3 app.py
```

- The authentication service will be served at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
- The messaging service will be served at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/).
- The notification service will be served at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

# Usage

## Step 1: Startup

After running all the services and frontend, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Step 2: Registering, Verifying, and Logging In

If you are a new user, navigate the UI to register. Enter a valid email address, username and password. You will be sent a verification email within 3 minutes. Navigate to your emails, click the link in the email, and you will be verified! Proceed to login.

## Step 3: Messaging

At the current time of writing, the UI for the messaging service is incomplete. This is because the messaging service was not made compatible with the rest of the project and so much effort was put to get those services working, instead of the UI. The messaging service endpoints are still functional however, and we invite you to test them with [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/). The endpoints are defined in the [project report](Project%20Report.pdf).

## Step 4: Notifications

You'll notice after sending some messages with postman, that notifications will have been created.

# Documentation

The project report, which includes more detailed specifications, such as the specific endpoints of each microservice, can be viewed [here](Project%20Report.pdf).

### ER Diagrams

This repository has class diagrams for each service, as well as their respective dependency diagrams. These diagrams can be viewed [here](./diagrams).

## Known Issues

Notification tests need to be changed so they grab the token from the authentication service before making the tests

## Other Comments

- The UI for the messaging service was not implemented because we were having CORS issues between the client and server. For a user to start a conversation, we were recquiring the receiver's user ID, which isn't intuitive, so we decided to scrap it.
- The image storing service was not implemented. The service would've required for it to communicate with the messaging service, but that wasn't accounted for.
