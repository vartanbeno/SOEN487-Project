This repository is for the SOEN 487 final project at Concordia University. You can find details about the contributors [here](https://github.com/vartanbeno/SOEN487-Project/wiki).

## Getting Started

### Running

To start the application, we need to run the frontend and each microservice in the backend:

#### Frontend

`cd` into the `client` folder and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will be served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

#### Backend

`cd` into the `server` folder. You will see one folder for each of the microservices. `cd` into each of them and run the `app.py` file:

```
python3 app.py
```

- The authentication service will be served at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
- The messaging service will be served at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/).
- The notification service will be served at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
